# Site of the Ehus

*Note: We are made up (of course). This is a childhood fantasy of our existence and imaginary place.*

## Food

We love Golden Chocolate Ehus. They resemble ourselves, so we love ourselves. They're expensive though, so we just eat *ordinary* Chocolate Ehus.

## History

There is a world called Ehu World with two lands called Ehuland which is our land and Ehaland. You know what that means... right?

We Ehus are the good guys, and Ehas are the bad guys. Ehus control the world, since the *good guys always win*. Nah... we just take advantage of them :D. They're not bad; we just hate them for no reason.

## Clothing

We have a common dress and wear blue pajamas and a blue santa hat. Christmas wear is our attire.

Ehas do not have a common dress. Christmas wear is also their attire unfortunately.
